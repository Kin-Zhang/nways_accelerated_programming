Solution

This is not the official solution but my personal solution... Maybe you can do better than me. I would like to thank Kayran Schmidt for his help in figuring out how to set up cuda one correctly. 

### Result Table

All of these are C/C++ version:

* Running Time is for 500 iterations. with running command `./cfd 64 500`

* All of following are tested on: Desktop setting: i9-12900KF, GPU 3090, with [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) environment.

* Except the first Raw, all other are use the improved serial code as the base file.

|  Approach  | Running Time(s) | Description  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| Raw Serial Baseline        | 7.2941    |   Problem: redundant on swap things|

Best screenshot, error checked same with serial code, always 0.00211211:
